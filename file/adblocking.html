    <h1>Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Because marketing and advertising has ruined the World Wide Web.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>For beginners.</h2>
    <p>
      At the very least use the ad blocker <a href="https://ublockorigin.com">uBlock Origin</a> on a PC. On Android you can use DNS changer <a href="https://git.frostnerd.com/PublicAndroidApps/smokescreen#installation">Nebulo</a> to block ads in all your apps by using <a href="https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-dns-new-addresses.html">AdGuard DNS</a> IPs: 94.140.14.14, 94.140.15.15.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>The Web has become infested with tools for advertising. Let's just call it what it is: sheer manipulation—evil*. By means of your and everyone else's data, accurate predictions are made about human behavior. Armed with such data, agencies are able to make you want things that you don't need by applying the right personally tailored stimuli. Websites have also become increasingly unpleasant to use: ads, cookie consent warnings, CPU intensive scripts, redundant content or visual effects, et cetera. All of this significantly decreases speed and increases bandwidth use. Fortunately you can set up impenetrable defenses; right after the anti-commercial break:</p>

    <p class="footnote">* A less provocative and perhaps more insightful take on advertising by philosopher Alain de Botton: <a href="https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-purpose-of-advertising">https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-purpose-of-advertising</a>.</p>
  
    <h2>It's not so bad, is it?</h2>
    <p>Take a look at bigthink.com, a seemingly respectable website featuring a video with genuine advice from an astronaut: <a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/be-a-better-leader">https://bigthink.com/videos/be-a-better-leader</a>. Tread carefully though, because it has 14 scripts from blacklisted sites executing code on your device by default.</p>

    <img src="./media/trackerexample.png" alt="µMatrix tracker log">
    <p class="media-source">—Image: screenshot of deprecated* µMatrix's allowed and blocked domains.</span></p>
    
    <p>These scripts' sole purposes are tracking and consumer manipulation. Hence why these domains—shown in dark red—are blacklisted by default as well. They are completely unnecessary for the website to function properly. Moreover, they decrease speed, increase bandwidth usage, and use more power. Take notice that there are non-blacklisted domains that run scripts by default as well; 15 of them. Unless you're adamant on reading comments or seeing superfluous annoying elements on the site, these can also be left disabled. That's 29 good-for-nothing scripts; “Take it all, you fools!” Their audacity is undeniable.</p>
  
    <p>Conversely, shown in dark green are the only domains that must be enabled in order for the video to play. Otherwise the website is usable with every other domain being blocked besides bigthink.com itself.</p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* Best to only use uBlock Origin&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. µMatrix has become unmaintained by its creator gorhill in order to fully focus on uBlock Origin&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>, which can more or less do anything µMatrix can&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></a>.</p>
     
    <h2>So, what to do?</h2>
    <!-- <p>Use <a href="https://www.startpage.com">Startpage</a> as your default search engine. It uses search results from Google, but pays for privacy. The runner up is <a href="duck.com">DuckDuckGo</a> whose search results aren't biased, just as private, but less accurate and complete.</p> -->
  
    <p>The software and extensions below should enable every layman to reduce their intrusive and unpleasant web experiences to zero, provided a willingness to learn and a pinch of experience (e.g., some websites' functionalities can be disabled without you realizing it).</p>
  
    <p>On a PC.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> browser: fast, <em>highly</em> customizable.</li>
      <li><a href="https://ublockorigin.com">uBlock Origin</a>: the only relevant ad blocker for browsers.<br>
        ↳ I recommend reading <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode">the manual</a> for medium blocking mode.<br>
        ↳ To get rid of cookie warnings go to <a href="https://filterlists.com/lists/i-dont-care-about-cookies">filterlists.com/lists/i-dont-care-about-cookies</a> and click “Subscribe”.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/-/blob/master/README.md">ClearURLs</a>: “automatically remove tracking elements from URLs”.</li>
      <li><a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi Search</a>: 100% privacy, 0% ads, superior search results&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span><span class="source">[]</span>.</li>
      <li>Use Linux. It is superior to Windows, besides for gaming—or is it?&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>; I use Arch based <a href="https://endeavouros.com">EndeavourOS</a>.<br>
        ↳ <a href="https://github.com/hectorm/hblock">hBlock</a>: “…gets a list of domains that serve ads, tracking scripts and malware from multiple sources and creates a hosts file, among other formats, that prevents your system from connecting to them.”</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>On Android.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> browser: fast, customizable.<br>
        ↳ Bottom right Vivaldi logo → Settings → Privacy → ☑ Block Trackers and Ads → Manage Ad Blocking Sources: ☐ Allow ads from our partners, ☑ Remove cookie warnings (I don't care about cookies).<br>
        ↳ Bottom right Vivaldi logo → Settings → Privacy → Privacy and security: ☑ Always use secure connections, ☑ 'Do Not Track', ☐ Broadcast IP for best WebRTC performance.

    <h2>Isn't ad blocking akin to theft?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p class="quote">“About blocking ads:
      It's important to note that blocking ads is <strong>NOT</strong> theft. Don't fall for this creepy idea, which is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.
      Ads and trackers violate our privacy, make websites much slower, and deliver dangerous malware. We say no to them.
      We have the right to decide what we download from the Internet, what we send to it, and what we display on our screen.
      We have the right to refuse downloading source code that works against us. It's our bandwidth and computer, and no-one can decide for us what to use them for.
      A service that has valuable features should be able to sell us a subscription, without blackmailing us with ominous ads.”</p>
    
    <p>Quoted from <a href="https://lichess.org/ads">https://lichess.org/ads</a>; from which I got some of the recommendations above. By the way, lichess is completely free, devoid of any ads and trackers, financed by its users. A prime example of how the World Wide Web could be, and should be.</p>
  
    <p><!-- There you have it: a list of proverbial Trojan condoms against literal Trojan horses.  -->Enjoy surfing the Web again.</p>
