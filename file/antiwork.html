    <h1>Antiwork, because ambition is overrated.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">From antiwork in the USA to “tang ping” (躺平) or “lying flat” in China, people are fed up with the grind. We shouldn't live to work, but work to live; we shouldn't serve the economy, the economy should serve us.</p>
    <!-- <p class="sub-title">We're all so busy, busy like bees. But the bees are dying, and so are we.</p> --> <!-- Bad comparison because bees do good work, we don't. -->

    <h2>Working hard ánd being antiwork?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.cynicusrex.com/file/quora.html#:~:text=many years ago">I enjoy working hard</a>, especially toward a common good, a noble goal, or simply helping a friend. The fruits of labour are immediately visible, and don't simply increase the profits of some intangible entity or harmful industry. Unfortunately the latter cases are ubiquitous; advertising, factory farming, car-centrism, financial speculation, exorbitant symptom suppressing instead of curative medicine, et cetera. Pardon my penchant for my black and white rhetoric, obviously not everything is bad. For instance, I have an indomitable esteem for good doctors or surgeons, even though some do it for the wrong reason. The fact that one can shatter a leg while  We've evermore become cogs in a profit squeezing machine: unappreciated, exploited, and replaceable. “But reduced pov…” No. Reduced poverty through capitalism is a lie <span class="source">[]</span> to justify our bukkake of luxury.</p>

    <p>Perhaps that's why ever since I can remember I've never liked the thought of work, or, “a job”. The same routine five days a week, seeing colleagues more than my friends, for the rest of my life … Predictable and thus boring. Especially considering the unfathomable amount of more interesting things to learn or do. Unless of course one is lucky enough to stumble upon <em>and</em> make ends meet with their dream job. But that's not “a job” anymore—something one is <a href="./pride.html#:~:text=obliged to do">obliged to do</a>—but rather a vocation—something one wants to do. Naturally every profession will have its moments of drudgery, but in general a vocation does not feel like a chore. Unlike being a cog.</p>

    <p>This is a remarkably touchy subject matter in several developed countries. “Cultures”* where people often take pride in their work regardless whether they enjoy it or its net negative consequences. In such work-obsessed societies it is often considered sacrilege to be critical of work. Therefore, I'll let one of the greatest minds do some unpaid work for me. I'm sorry Albert, “you're doing it for the exposure” <span class="source">[]</span>.</p>

    <p class="media-source">—ASCII art of Albert Einstein <span class="source">[]</span>.</p>
    <p class="quote">“Einstein struck a more serious pose when he addressed the Caltech student body near the end of his stay. His sermon, grounded in his humanistic outlook, was on how science had not yet been harnessed to do more good than harm. During war it gave people “the means to poison and mutilate one another,” and in peacetime it “has made our lives hurried and uncertain.” <strong>Instead of being a liberating force, “it has enslaved men to machines” by making them work “long wearisome hours mostly without joy in their labor.”</strong> Concern for making life better for ordinary humans must be the chief object of science. “Never forget this when you are pondering over your diagrams and equations!”” —Albert Einstein <span class="quote-year">(1879 – 1955)</span> <span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <p>And another intellectual paragon:</p>

    <p class="quote">“We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.” —Buckminster Fuller <span class="quote-year">(1895 – 1983)</span> <span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* I consider my country, Belgium, a culture of no culture. Unless one can consider culture to consist of televised trivia games, and beer, which I don't. I once asked my Chinese flatmate “how would you describe our culture?” After a moment's gaze at the ceiling he said: “Cold.” Asking the same question to fellow countrymen usually proceeds in a similar fashion.</p>

    <h2>“Unemployment for all, not just the rich!” <span class="source">[]</span></h2>

    <p>Powerful. But even though it's true in many cases, I'd take it down a notch so people don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. “<a href="./play.html">Work less, play more!</a>” should suffice. Unfortunately, the unemployed or partly employed are often looked down upon, which is entirely unjustified. As long as a person does no harm, or doesn't prevent harm from being done, then. Nothing else matters besides living morally. Come on folks, don't point at each other, we have a common enemy:</p>

    <p class="quote">“People who dismiss the unemployed and dependent as ‘parasites’ fail to understand economics and parasitism. A successful parasite is one that is not recognized by its host, one that can make its host work for it without appearing as a burden. Such is the ruling class in a capitalist society.” —Jason Read</p>

    <h2>Climbing as a counterculture.</h2>

    <p class="quote">“The idea of devoting your life to climbing didn't exist anywhere else. None of us ever expected to have a job. We were gonna be hobos basically. And we were gonna climb forever, and that was the extent of it.” —Yvon Chouinard <span class="source">[]</span></p> 

    <p class="quote">Narrator: “The epicenter of the emerging climbing scene was Camp 4, a shady patch of the valley floor that became the sherwood forest for this band of merry mountaineers.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“Living in Camp 4, instead of making money, the idea was to reduce the overhead. It wasn't the way normal people live.” —Glen Denny</p>

    <p class="quote">“One summer I went to a damaged can store and bought a bunch of damaged cans of cat food, that's what we ate. I mean it was a total dirtbag existence.” —Yvon Chouinard</p>

    <p class="quote">“Life in Camp 4 really took on a anti establishment countercultural tone. There was a whole revolution of attitudes going on in our society at that time. Climbing was just a manifestation of that.” —Rich Calderwood.</p>

    <p class="quote">“We hated authority. I still hate authority.” —Steve Roper</p>

    <p class="quote">“But there was one man vying for Royal's title as king of the big walls. Warren Harding, an impish road surveyor with his own appetite for glory. His mother named him after a president, but in his thirties he was still living at home. Boozing heavily, and curing his hangovers with the adrenaline rush of climbing.”</p>

    <p>“When you picture Harding, you're picturing a hard hack construction worker with a serious drinking problem and a penchant for a lot of women, radical sports cars, and a really childish sense of humor.”</p>
