    <h1>Einstein was antiwork! Yet, he worked hard.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">From antiwork in the USA to “tang ping” (躺平) or “lying flat” in China, people are fed up with the grind. Could it be that we shouldn't live to work, but work to live? That we shouldn't serve the economy, but the economy should serve us?</p>
    <!-- <p class="sub-title">We're all so busy, busy like bees. But the bees are dying, and so are we.</p> --> <!-- Bad comparison because bees do good work, we don't. -->

    <h2>Working hard ánd being antiwork?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.cynicusrex.com/file/quora.html#:~:text=many years ago">I enjoy working hard</a>, especially toward a common good, a noble goal, or simply helping a friend. The fruits of labour are immediately visible and don't merely increase the profits of some intangible entity or harmful industry. Unfortunately the harm is everywhere: advertising, factory farming, microplastics, forever chemicals, car-centrism, gambling with pension funds, disproportionate symptom suppressing instead of curative medicine, wealth inequality, et cetera. Sift it all through and we get to greed, the root cause of most of society's problems.</p>

    <p>Due to that greed we've evermore become cogs in a profit squeezing machine: unappreciated, exploited, replaceable—and, being valued as such, we similarly purchase and discard our planned obsolete products, or whatever else we take for granted. Just as Marx foretold, we're witnessing the “alienation of work”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span><span class="source">[]</span>.<!--  And, no, Capitalism reducing poverty is a lie&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span> to justify our bukkake of luxury. --> This alienation is a major reason why as long as I can remember I've never looked forward to “work”, or, having “a job”. The same routine five days a week, seeing colleagues more than my friends, for the rest of my life… why? Unless one is lucky enough to stumble upon their <a href="./pride.html#:~:text=Work consists of">dream job</a>, i.e., vocation, there are little to no good reasons to continue doing so. We are rich enough, <a href="./play.html#:~:text=time is the most valuable resource">short on time</a>, and there's a vast amount of more interesting things to learn or to do.<!--  Such as actually innovating, which does not require a profit motive. --></p>

    <!-- <p>Okay, <a href="./pride.html#:~:text=Mass production">not <em>all</em> is bad</a>. Pardon my ad nauseam use of the same example, but I have an endless esteem for good doctors or surgeons, even if some do it for the wrong reasons. The fact that one can shatter a leg and still skateboard a year later is amazing—everyone should have access to such breathtaking modern medicine—attached at the hip of science and technology.</p> -->

    <p>Alas. This remains a remarkably touchy subject. People in Western “cultures”* often take pride in their work regardless whether they enjoy it or its net negative consequences as aforementioned. In such work-obsessed societies it is often considered sacrilege to be critical of work. Therefore, I'll let one of the greatest minds do some unpaid work for me. I'm sorry Albert, “you're doing it for the exposure”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>

    <p class="media-source">—ASCII art of Albert Einstein&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>
    <p class="quote">“Einstein struck a more serious pose when he addressed the Caltech student body near the end of his stay. His sermon, grounded in his humanistic outlook, was on how science had not yet been harnessed to do more good than harm. During war it gave people “the means to poison and mutilate one another,” and in peacetime it “has made our lives hurried and uncertain.” <strong>Instead of being a liberating force, “it has enslaved men to machines” by making them work “long wearisome hours mostly without joy in their labor.”</strong> Concern for making life better for ordinary humans must be the chief object of science. “Never forget this when you are pondering over your diagrams and equations!”” —Albert Einstein <span class="quote-year">(1879 – 1955)</span>&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <p>Another intellectual paragon to boot:</p>

    <p class="quote">“We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.” —Buckminster Fuller <span class="quote-year">(1895 – 1983)</span>&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <p>Clearly, the antiwork movement is <em>not</em> new and <em>not</em> for the lazy. It's the other way around. To me, “antiwork” means striving for a society where people don't want to be lazy, a society with a vision that people deem worthy to dedicate their life to; something ant colonies do by default, but we need good reasons to—profit not being one of them.</p>

    <p>That's why I think their slogan “Unemployment for all, not just the rich!”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>, sends the wrong message, despite being largely true. We want to avoid people throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Unfortunately, the unemployed or partly employed are often looked down upon, which is entirely unjustified. As long as a person does no harm, or doesn't prevent harm from being done, then. Nothing else matters besides living morally. Come on folks, don't point at each other, we have a common enemy:</p>

    <p class="quote">“People who dismiss the unemployed and dependent as ‘parasites’ fail to understand economics and parasitism. A successful parasite is one that is not recognized by its host, one that can make its host work for it without appearing as a burden. Such is the ruling class in a capitalist society.” —Jason Read</p></p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* I consider my country, Belgium, a culture of no culture. Unless one considers culture to consist of trivia game shows and beer, which I don't. I once asked my Chinese flatmate “how would you describe our culture?” After a moment's gaze at the ceiling he said: “Cold.” Asking the same question to fellow countrymen usually proceeds in a similar fashion.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>Powerful. But even though it's true in many cases, 

    <h2>Climbing as a counterculture.</h2>

    <p class="quote">“The idea of devoting your life to climbing didn't exist anywhere else. None of us ever expected to have a job. We were gonna be hobos basically. And we were gonna climb forever, and that was the extent of it.” —Yvon Chouinard&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p> 

    <p class="quote">Narrator: “The epicenter of the emerging climbing scene was Camp 4, a shady patch of the valley floor that became the sherwood forest for this band of merry mountaineers.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“Living in Camp 4, instead of making money, the idea was to reduce the overhead. It wasn't the way normal people live.” —Glen Denny</p>

    <p class="quote">“One summer I went to a damaged can store and bought a bunch of damaged cans of cat food, that's what we ate. I mean it was a total dirtbag existence.” —Yvon Chouinard</p>

    <p class="quote">“Life in Camp 4 really took on a anti establishment countercultural tone. There was a whole revolution of attitudes going on in our society at that time. Climbing was just a manifestation of that.” —Rich Calderwood.</p>

    <p class="quote">“We hated authority. I still hate authority.” —Steve Roper</p>

    <p class="quote">“But there was one man vying for Royal's title as king of the big walls. Warren Harding, an impish road surveyor with his own appetite for glory. His mother named him after a president, but in his thirties he was still living at home. Boozing heavily, and curing his hangovers with the adrenaline rush of climbing.”</p>

    <p>“When you picture Harding, you're picturing a hard hack construction worker with a serious drinking problem and a penchant for a lot of women, radical sports cars, and a really childish sense of humor.”</p>
