    <title>Einstein's theory of antiwork.</title>
    <description>From antiwork in the USA to ‚Äútang ping‚Äù (Ë∫∫Âπ≥) or ‚Äúlying flat‚Äù in China, people are fed up with the grind. Could it be that we shouldn't live to work, but work to live? That we shouldn't serve the economy, but the economy should serve us?</description>

    <title>Web4 should run on LaTeX.</title>
    <description>The World Wide Web is broken: it is dominated by a handful of websites, nearly everything is financed by ads, bloated tech needlessly slows down surfing, NFTs and blockchain are digital cancer, et cetera. Stop it. Just stop it.</description>

    <title>The folly of pride.</title>
    <description>Winning necessarily comes down to luck or the defeat of an inferior. Both are nothing to be proud of. Therefore, we should not compete for the sake of being better than others, but only to improve ourselves and help others do the same.</description>

    <title>I wish I never bought bitcoin.</title>
    <description>Bitcoin incentivizes greed. It robbed me from my childlike curiosity and fascination for science. Bitcoin is the biggest inadvertent pyramid scheme ever and blockchain is snake oil. Take your spam elsewhere.</description>

    <title>Work less, play more!</title>

An article originally written for the magazine Zoeklicht. I omitted one paragraph about bitcoin because I now strongly oppose crypto‚Äúcurrencies‚Äù.</description>
